From that heat amount and an energy balance, the temperature of the exiting fluid can be estimated. The governing equation for the heat transfer is based on the Log Mean Tempearture Difference (LMTD) approach and is:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The heat exchanged is also equal to the energy picked up by the fluid (water) after passing through the exchanger and is equivalent to:\n",
        "$Q = \\dot{m}\\cdot C_p\\cdot \\Delta T$\n",
        "\n",

The images with the equations and drawings here are directly from the NCEES Handbook for chemical engineering."

Doing so can be very useful in understanding the problem and getting a feel for the outcome and expected results. It sometimes can be very easy to dive deeply into a problem and get lost with mistakes easily derailing your complex analysis. Doing a back-of-the-envelope estimate can help with that."
